      <h1 class="section__title">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p class="muted">These terms govern services supplied by <strong>The Upkeep Group Pty Ltd</strong> (“<strong>Upkeep</strong>”, “we”, “us”) to the customer (“<strong>Client</strong>”, “you”).</p>

      <h3>1. Engagement &amp; Scope</h3>
      <p>Work is delivered under an accepted Quote or Statement of Work (SOW) specifying scope, KPIs, service levels, sites, and pricing. If there is any conflict, the SOW/Quote prevails over these Terms for that engagement.</p>

      <h3>2. Quotes, Rates &amp; Variations</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Quotes are valid for 30 days unless stated otherwise.</li>
        <li>Ad-hoc or out-of-scope work is billed at the agreed schedule of rates.</li>
        <li>Scope changes require written approval and may adjust fees and timelines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Invoicing &amp; Payment</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Invoices are issued per the SOW/Quote (e.g., monthly in advance/arrears, milestone, or time &amp; materials).</li>
        <li>Payment terms are <strong>14 days EOM</strong> unless otherwise stated.</li>
        <li>Late or overdue amounts may incur administrative or interest charges permitted by law, and service suspension may apply after notice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. WHS, Site Access &amp; Client Obligations</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>We comply with applicable Work Health &amp; Safety (WHS) requirements. Client must provide safe access, site inductions, and disclose hazards.</li>
        <li>Client provides timely instructions, approvals, and necessary materials (e.g., keys, passes, data, systems access).</li>
        <li>Client ensures utilities and amenities needed to perform work are available.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Labour Hire &amp; Employment Compliance</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Where we supply on-hire labour, staff remain our personnel. We handle screening, payroll, superannuation, and award interpretation.</li>
        <li>Client supervises the day-to-day tasks on site and ensures a safe working environment.</li>
        <li>Licensing requirements (if applicable) will be observed in relevant jurisdictions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. IT &amp; Data Services</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>For IT work, Client remains responsible for overall data stewardship and backups unless our SOW explicitly assumes those duties.</li>
        <li>We recommend MFA, least-privilege access, tested backups and DR drills. Residual cyber risk cannot be eliminated entirely.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Deliverables, Acceptance &amp; Defects</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Deliverables are deemed accepted on the earlier of: (a) Client sign-off; (b) production use; or (c) 10 business days after delivery without written rejection specifying defects.</li>
        <li>For valid defects notified within the warranty window stated in the SOW (or 30 days if not stated), we will remedy with reasonable efforts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Confidentiality &amp; IP</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Each party must keep the other’s confidential information secure and only use it to perform obligations under the engagement.</li>
        <li>Pre-existing IP remains with the owner. Unless agreed otherwise in writing, we grant the Client a non-exclusive licence to use deliverables for internal business purposes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Privacy</h3>
      <p>We handle personal information in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Client must ensure any data shared with us is collected and disclosed lawfully.</p>

      <h3>10. Insurance</h3>
      <p>We maintain customary cover (e.g., Public Liability, Professional Indemnity where relevant, and Workers’ Compensation). Certificates of currency are available on request.</p>

      <h3>11. Liability</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>To the extent permitted by law, liability is limited at our option to resupplying the services or paying the cost of resupply.</li>
        <li>We are not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of profit, revenue, data, or business interruption.</li>
        <li>Nothing limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or other liability that cannot be excluded by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>12. Cancellations, Suspension &amp; Termination</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Either party may terminate for material breach if not remedied within 14 days of notice.</li>
        <li>Cleaning/labour rosters may require minimum notice (as set out in the SOW) to avoid stand-down or cancellation charges.</li>
        <li>On termination, Client pays for services performed and reasonable demobilisation costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>13. Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, major outages, industrial action). Obligations resume when the event ends.</p>

      <h3>14. Disputes</h3>
      <p>Parties will first attempt good-faith negotiation between operational contacts, then senior management. If unresolved after 30 days, either party may pursue available legal remedies.</p>

      <h3>15. Governing Law</h3>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>New South Wales, Australia</strong>. Parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of its courts.</p>

      <h3>16. Changes to Terms</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The version in force at the time of your SOW/Quote acceptance applies to that engagement unless both parties agree otherwise.</p>

      <h3>17. Contact</h3>
